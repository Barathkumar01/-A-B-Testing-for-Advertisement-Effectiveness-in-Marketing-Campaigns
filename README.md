This project focuses on conducting an A/B test to assess the effectiveness of targeted advertisements in a marketing campaign. By comparing the conversion rates between the experimental group (exposed to advertisements) and the control group (exposed to a Public Service Announcement), the project aims to quantify the impact of ads on customer behavior and estimate the resulting revenue uplift.

- **Conversion Rates**:
  - **Ad Group Conversion Rate**: 2.55%
  - **PSA Group Conversion Rate**: 1.79%
