# A/B Testing for Advertisement Effectiveness in Marketing Campaigns

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an A/B test to assess the effectiveness of targeted advertisements in a marketing campaign. By comparing the conversion rates between the experimental group (exposed to advertisements) and the control group (exposed to a Public Service Announcement), the project aims to quantify the impact of ads on customer behavior and estimate the resulting revenue uplift.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Data Analysis**: Processed user behavior data (588k users) to analyze ad exposure and conversions.
- **Statistical Testing**: Applied hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests) to evaluate the significance of the difference in conversion rates between the ad and PSA groups.
- **Conversion Rates**:
  - **Ad Group Conversion Rate**: 2.55%
  - **PSA Group Conversion Rate**: 1.79%
- **Revenue Impact**:
  - Estimated a **$700,150 revenue uplift** attributed to the ad campaign.
  - Demonstrated a **0.76% increase in conversion rates** driven by the ads.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scipy), Jupyter Notebook
- **Statistical Testing**: t-test, chi-square test
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Impact
- **Conversion Rate Increase**: Identified a significant improvement in conversion rates for the ad group.
- **Revenue Uplift**: Estimated a **$700,150 revenue increase** from the targeted ad campaign.
- **Insights**: Provided actionable insights for optimizing future ad campaigns and marketing strategies.
